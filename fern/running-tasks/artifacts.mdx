## What are Artifacts?

Artifacts are files and data generated during the execution of Skyvern tasks and workflows. They provide valuable insights into what happened during a run and can be used for debugging, auditing, or extracting additional information from your automation runs.

## Types of Artifacts

Skyvern generates several types of artifacts during execution:

### Visual Artifacts
- **Screenshots**: Captures of the browser state at different points during execution
  - `screenshot_llm`: Screenshots sent to the LLM for decision making
  - `screenshot_action`: Screenshots taken before/after actions
  - `screenshot_final`: Final screenshot of the completed task
- **Recordings**: Video recordings of the entire task execution (`recording`)

### Debug and Analysis Artifacts
- **HTML Snapshots**: The raw HTML of pages during execution (`html_scrape`, `html_action`)
- **Element Trees**: Structured representation of page elements (`visible_elements_tree`)
- **Browser Logs**: Console logs from the browser (`browser_console_log`)
- **HAR Files**: Network activity logs (`har`)

### AI and LLM Artifacts
- **LLM Requests**: The prompts sent to language models (`llm_request`)
- **LLM Responses**: Raw responses from language models (`llm_response`)
- **LLM Parsed Responses**: Structured data extracted from LLM responses (`llm_response_parsed`)

### Debugging Artifacts
- **Skyvern Logs**: Internal Skyvern execution logs (`skyvern_log`)
- **Trace Data**: Detailed execution traces for debugging (`trace`)

## Retrieving Artifacts

### Get Artifacts for a Run

Retrieve all artifacts associated with a specific task run or workflow run:

```python
from skyvern import Skyvern

client = Skyvern(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# Get all artifacts for a run
artifacts = await client.artifacts.get_run_artifacts(run_id="tsk_v2_123")

# Filter by specific artifact types
screenshot_artifacts = await client.artifacts.get_run_artifacts(
    run_id="tsk_v2_123",
    artifact_type=["screenshot_llm", "screenshot_action"]
)
```

### Get a Specific Artifact

Retrieve a specific artifact by its ID:

```python
# Get a specific artifact
artifact = await client.artifacts.get_artifact(artifact_id="artifact_123")

# The artifact object contains metadata and a signed URL for downloading
print(f"Artifact Type: {artifact.artifact_type}")
print(f"Download URL: {artifact.signed_url}")
print(f"Created: {artifact.created_at}")
```

## Artifact Object Structure

Each artifact contains the following information:

```json
{
  "artifact_id": "art_123456",
  "artifact_type": "screenshot_llm",
  "uri": "s3://bucket/path/to/artifact",
  "signed_url": "https://presigned-url-for-download",
  "task_id": "tsk_123",
  "step_id": "step_456", 
  "workflow_run_id": "wr_789",
  "created_at": "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "modified_at": "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "organization_id": "org_123"
}
```

## Downloading Artifact Content

Use the `signed_url` field to download the actual artifact content:

```python
import httpx

# Get the artifact
artifact = await client.artifacts.get_artifact(artifact_id="artifact_123")

# Download the content using the signed URL
async with httpx.AsyncClient() as http_client:
    response = await http_client.get(artifact.signed_url)
    content = response.content
    
    # Save to file
    with open(f"artifact_{artifact.artifact_id}.{artifact.artifact_type}", "wb") as f:
        f.write(content)
```

## Use Cases

### Debugging Failed Tasks
When a task fails, examine the artifacts to understand what went wrong:
- Review the final screenshot to see the end state
- Check LLM requests/responses to understand decision making
- Examine browser console logs for JavaScript errors

### Quality Assurance
Use artifacts to verify task execution:
- Screenshots show the visual state at each step
- Recordings provide a complete visual audit trail
- HTML snapshots preserve the exact page content

### Data Extraction Verification
For extraction tasks, artifacts help verify results:
- Compare extracted data with actual page content from HTML artifacts
- Review LLM responses to understand extraction reasoning
- Use screenshots to visually confirm extracted information

## Best Practices

1. **Filter Artifacts**: Use the `artifact_type` parameter to retrieve only the artifacts you need
2. **Handle Signed URLs**: Signed URLs are temporary - download content promptly if needed
3. **Organize Downloads**: Use artifact metadata (type, timestamp) to organize downloaded files
4. **Monitor Storage**: Be mindful of artifact storage costs in cloud deployments
