# Azure Blob Storage Implementation Summary

This implementation adds Azure Blob Storage support to Skyvern alongside the existing AWS S3 storage support. The implementation follows the same architecture as the S3 storage implementation and ensures complete compatibility.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. **skyvern/forge/sdk/api/azure.py** (NEW)
- Created `AsyncAzureClient` class for async Azure Blob Storage operations
- Implemented `AzureBlobUri` parser for handling `azure://` URIs
- Added `AzureBlobTier` enum for storage tiers (Hot, Cool, Cold, Archive)
- Implemented all necessary methods:
  - `upload_file()`, `upload_file_stream()`, `upload_file_from_path()`
  - `download_file()`, `delete_file()`
  - `list_files()`, `get_file_metadata()`
  - `create_presigned_url()`, `create_presigned_urls()`

### 2. **skyvern/forge/sdk/artifact/storage/azure_blob.py** (NEW)
- Created `AzureBlobStorage` class inheriting from `BaseStorage`
- Implemented all abstract methods required by BaseStorage
- Supports all artifact types: screenshots, HAR files, logs, browser sessions, downloads
- Maintains same URI structure as S3 but with `azure://` prefix
- Supports custom blob tiers and tags per organization

### 3. **skyvern/config.py** (MODIFIED)
- Added Azure-specific configuration settings:
  - `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME`
  - `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY`
  - `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING`
  - `AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER_ARTIFACTS`
  - `AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER_SCREENSHOTS`
  - `AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER_BROWSER_SESSIONS`
  - `AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER_UPLOADS`
- Updated `SKYVERN_STORAGE_TYPE` comment to include "azure" option

### 4. **skyvern/forge/app.py** (MODIFIED)
- Added import for `AzureBlobStorage`
- Updated storage initialization logic to support Azure:
  ```python
  elif SettingsManager.get_settings().SKYVERN_STORAGE_TYPE == "azure":
      StorageFactory.set_storage(AzureBlobStorage())
  ```

### 5. **skyvern/forge/sdk/workflow/models/constants.py** (MODIFIED)
- Added `AZURE = "azure"` to `FileStorageType` enum

### 6. **pyproject.toml** (MODIFIED)
- Added `azure-storage-blob = "^12.23.1"` dependency

### 7. **docker-compose.yml** (MODIFIED)
- Added comprehensive Azure Blob Storage configuration comments

### 8. **skyvern/forge/sdk/artifact/storage/test_azure_blob_storage.py** (NEW)
- Created unit tests for Azure Blob Storage implementation
- Tests all URI building methods
- Follows same pattern as S3 storage tests

### 9. **AZURE_STORAGE_SETUP.md** (NEW)
- Comprehensive documentation for Azure Blob Storage setup
- Configuration examples
- Troubleshooting guide
- Security best practices

## Key Features

1. **Full Feature Parity with S3**: All features available in S3 storage are implemented for Azure
2. **Async Operations**: Uses Azure SDK's async client for efficient operations
3. **Presigned URLs**: Generates SAS tokens for temporary access
4. **Metadata Support**: Supports custom metadata on blobs (e.g., checksums)
5. **Blob Tiers**: Supports all Azure blob tiers (Hot, Cool, Cold, Archive)
6. **Tags**: Supports custom tags for organization and billing
7. **URI Format**: Uses `azure://container/path` format similar to S3's `s3://bucket/path`

## Configuration

To use Azure Blob Storage, set:
```bash
SKYVERN_STORAGE_TYPE=azure
AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING="your_connection_string"
# OR
AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME=your_account_name
AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY=your_account_key
```

## Switching Between Storage Providers

Users can easily switch between storage providers:
- `SKYVERN_STORAGE_TYPE=local` - Local file system
- `SKYVERN_STORAGE_TYPE=s3` - AWS S3
- `SKYVERN_STORAGE_TYPE=azure` - Azure Blob Storage

## AWS S3 Support Preserved

The implementation ensures that:
1. All existing AWS S3 functionality remains unchanged
2. No AWS-specific code was modified or removed
3. Users can switch between S3 and Azure without code changes
4. Both storage providers can coexist in the same deployment

## Testing

The implementation includes:
- Unit tests for URI building
- Verification that all abstract methods are implemented
- Syntax validation for all new files

## Next Steps for Production Use

1. Install Azure SDK: `pip install azure-storage-blob` (already added to pyproject.toml)
2. Create Azure Storage Account and containers
3. Configure environment variables
4. Test with actual Azure credentials
5. Consider implementing Azure Managed Identity support for enhanced security
